# Python Starting Code for Math 221, Spring 2018

This is simply a reproduce of Professor Per-Olof Persson's Matlab starting code. 

Feel free to raise issues / create a pull request if you have a better implementation.

If you are switching from Matlab to python/numpy, please take a look at [this page](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html).
